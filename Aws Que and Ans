IAM

1. What is cloud computing ?
Ans: Cloud computing is delivery of various services data storage, servers, databases, softwares and networking using internet. Instead of buying, owning and maintaning physical data 
     centers and servers you can access various kind of services via internet.
     scalabilty - it means when load comes to server, servers will scale up(increase) and when load decrases server's will scale down.
     elastticity - elasticity means when loads comes then we can increase the size of memory or ram, we can create a volume and attach it,also when loads decreases we can detach.

S3 :

1. Difference between Block storage & Object Storage ?
Ans:
   1. Block storage:
      Data is divided into equally sized blocks these are fixed size blocks.
      Each block has a unique identifier.
      When data needs to be retrieved the data lookup table is used to find the required blocks.
      In block storage we can store os but in object storage we cant.
      Distributed across SSD and HDD.
    2.  Object storage:
      Data is stored in objects in bucket.
      We can store documents, images, files or data also this files metadata is stored.
      The metadata can include attributes like the unique identifier, object name, size, file creation data.
      Object storage is used in S3 service.

2. Difference between static website & dynamic website ?
Ans: 
    a) Static website:  
       > In static website, web pages are returned by the server which are prebuild source code files built using simple languages such as HTML, CSS or Javascript.
       > It is stable therefore static websites are fast.
       > In static website no interaction with database.
  
   b) Dynamic website:
         > In dynamic website, web pages are not prebuild, pages are built during runtime according to the users demand with the help of server-side scripting languages
           such as PHP, Node.js,ASP, .net.
         > Content of webpages can be changed.
         > Here database is present,
         > It is slower than static website
         > Cost is more.
          
3. What are the naming rules ?
Ans:
   1Bucket names can only contain lowercase letters, numeric characters, dashes ( - ), underscores ( _ ), and dots ( . ). ...
   Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
   Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
   Every bucket name must be globally unique.

     3. Also maximum size if S3 bucket about 5TB.

8. Why is MFA Delete important in S3 Bucket object level ?
Ans: MFA delete can help prevent accidental bucket deletion. MFA code adding an extra layer of security

9. What is S3 Multipart upload ?
Ans: 1. Multipart upload allows you to upload large a object as set of smaller objects.
     2. After all parts your objects uploaded, amazon S3 then  presents the data as a single object.

10.What are the storage classes in Amazon S3 ?   â€”------------------- IMP
Ans:
    1. Amazon S3 Standard(30 days): > It is used for general purpose. Here data is frequnetly accessed.
    2. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering: > It moves data automatically to the most effective storage class
                                      > It automatically decrases the users storage cost.
    
    3. Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access(60 Days): > To access less frequently user data, user used standard Infrequent Access.
                                                      > Also it provide rapid access when it required.
                                                      > S3 IA moves objects that have not been accessed in 30 consecutive Days.
    
    4. Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access: > In this data is stored in one zone(single AZ), thats why cost is less.
                                             > It it good choice for storing secondary backup.

    5. Amazon S3 Glacier(90 Days): > It is lowest cost storage for long lived data which accessed in few times per year.
                                   > objects are moving that have been not accessed in 90 consecutive Days.

    6. Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive(180 Days): > Used for store data long period.
                                                 > Restored data within 10 hours.
                                                 > It is cheapest storage class.

11. What is ACL ?
Ans: ACL stands for access control list. It is used for manage access to buckets and objects.

12.Why do we need ACL ?
Ans: 1. Each bucket and objects has ACL attached to it as a subresource.
     2. When we enable the ACL, then we can change the owenership og object, we can make them public.
     3. ACL defines that which aws account can or groups are granted access and the type of access.
     4. When a requset is received against a resource, amazon s3 checks the corresponding ACL to verify that the requester has the necessary access permission.

13.What is a Life cycle policy ? Why do we need to use the life cycle rule ?
Ans: 1. lifecycle policy consists of one or more rules that determines which images in a repository should be expired.
     2. lifecycle rule used to manage your objects, so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle.
     3. Lifecycle rule is used to transfer objects in another storage class, archieve them and delete them automactically. so we can create lifecycle rule and attach.

14.How can we make our bucket public ?
Ans: S3 -> Bucket -> permission -> Block public access-> enable

15.How can we give public access to our bucket ?
16.Aws pricing factor of the S3 Service.
Ans: 1. You pay for objects in your buckets.
     2. The rate you charged depends on your object size, how long you stored the objects.
     3. Also depends on which storage class you used for store your objects.

17.How can we make our object public ?
Ans: S3 -> Bucket -> Bucket_name -> select object -> Actions -> make object public.
19.How can we configure the static website logs in s3 ?

20.What is CORS ?
Ans: CORS stands for cross-origin resource sharing.It is the one of resource of s3.
     The CORS configuration, written in JSON, defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain

21.What is S3 Inventory ?
Ans: 1. Path = S3 â†’ bucket â†’ Management â†’ Inventory rule
     2. Using s3 inventory you can pull the report.
     3. You can configure multiple inventory lists for a bucket
     4. You can create an inventory for collecting the metadata of your nodes.

22.What does it mean by Requester pays ?
ANS: > Generally bucket owner pays for storage of data in s3, but if requester is requesting access for the data, then he needs to pay instead of bucket owner.
     > Basically bucket owner pays for data which is stored in bucket, we can create bucket as a requeste pays, so whenver requester is accessing data of that bucket.
       instead of bucket owner pays, requester is paying.

23. What is the secondary word to Transfer acceleration ? why we need to use this transfer acceleration ?
Ans: 1. Amazon transfer location is effective for minimizing or eliminating latenecy which is caused by geogrphical location between globally distributed clients and regional 
        application.
     2. Transfer Acceleration uses the globally distributed edge locations in CloudFront for data transport.
     3. The AWS edge network has points of presence in more than 50 locations.
     4. so caches are stored at this edge locations and we are able access DNS rapidly.

24. Difference between Security Group & NACL ?
Ans: 1. NACL operates at the subnet level and controls traffic in and out of a vpc.
     2. Security groups operate at the instance level and controls traffic to and from individual EC2 instances.
     3. ACLs apply to all instances in a subnet while security group apply to individual instances.

25. What are NACL & Its types ?(https://www.javatpoint.com/aws-nacl)
Ans: 1. A network ACL is an optional layer of security that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of a subnet. 
     2. NACL stands for network access control list.
     3. Your custom VPC automatically comes with the default Network ACL which includes all inbound and outbound ipv4 traffic.
Two types:
    a) Custom Network ACL:Custom Network ACL is a user-defined Network ACL, and by default, it denies all the inbound and outboud traffic until you add rules.
    b) Default network ACL:  The default Network ACL allows all the traffic to flow in or out of the subnet which is associated with it.

26. How many IP Addresses can we attach to the instances ?
Ans: we can attach 5 elastic ip to instance.

27. How many types of volume states do we have ?
28. What is a key pair, and its types ?
Ans: A key pair is a combination of a public key that is used to encrypt data and a private key that is used to decrypt data. 
     Types : public and private key.

29. What is load balancer and its types ?
Ans: Load balancer: The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets(server), such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones.

     Types:  
     1. Classic load balancer
     2. Application load balancer
     3. Network load balancer
     4. Gateway load balancer

30. How does the load balancer work in the backend? Can you explain it ?
Ans: 1. Classic load balancer checks the health of each registered target and routes traffic only to the health targets.
     2. Suppose one website is hosted and users are hitting that website url so classic load balancer distributes traffic among three servers using a round robin algorithm. 
     3. It checks the health of the server . If any server is healthy then it routes traffic to the next server.

31. Features of Load Balancers ?
Ans: 1. High availability
     2. Load balancing algorithm
     3. Route traffic only to healthy targets.
     4. Fixed Response

32. What is ASG ? & Its types ?
Ans: Aws autoscaling monitor your server, and if load comes then it scale up servers and when load decrease it scale downs.

a) Vertical auto scaling(used in testing):
  Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing ec2 machine.
b) Horizontal autoscaling(used in production):
   Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more ec2 machines into your pool of resources.(replica is creating of server).

33. What is a Health Check ?
Ans: Health checks are a way of asking a service on a particular server whether or not it is capable of performing work successfully. 
     Load balancers ask each server this question periodically to determine which servers it is safe to direct traffic to.

34. What is the threshold ?
35. What is the group of LB ?
Ans: 
36. Why do we prefer ALB over ALB ?
37. Difference between Web server & Application server ?
Ans:                web-server                                             Application server
        1. Web servers deliver responses to simple requests.        1. An application server delivers more complex content from databases, 
                                                                       services, and enterprise systems.
        2. Web servers primarily use HTTP.                          2. Application servers support many protocols. 
           They also support FTP and SMTP.
        3. Web servers deliver static content, like HTML pages,     3. Application servers deliver dynamic content, like real-time 
           images, videos, and files.                                  updatespersonalized information, and  customer support.

38. What is the target group ?
39. What is the desired capacity in ASG ?
40. How many types of the Scaling option ?
41. Scaling plans ?
42. Types Auto scaling
43. Difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling ?
Ans: a) Vertical auto scaling(used in testing):
        Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing ec2 machine.
     b) Horizontal autoscaling(used in production):
        Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more ec2 machines into your pool of resources.(replica is creating of server).

44. Difference between AMI & Snapshot ?
Ans: a) AWS AMI Image:
     1. we are creating AMI images from instance. In this software is copied.
     2. AMI images are used to creating instance, we just need to select storage.
     3. This is used in organization where we need to create same cofiguration server daily.

    b) Snapshot:
     1. we are using snapshot for backup purpose, we can take snapshot of server or we can schedule task for snapshot.

45. EC2 instance quotes?
Ans: 1. On-Demand instance : > In spot instance you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments.
                             > You have full control over the instance's lifecycleâ€”you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it.

     2. Spot instance : > spot instance unable you to request unused instance, it uses spare ec2 instance capacity. The price of ec2 instance is lesser that on- demand instance
                        > Your Spot Instance runs whenever capacity is available.

     3. Reserved instances: > You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment.

     4. Dedicated instance: > dedicated instance are dedicated to single customer.A Dedicated Host is also a physical server that's dedicated for your use.

46. What is Autoscaling and steps of autoscaling?
Ans: When loads comes on server, autoscaling policy creates the server automactically and when load decrease it scale downs the servers.
     benefits: 1. High availability - It provides the high availablity, autoscaling checks the health of instances and routes the traffic only to healthy instance.
               2. Fault tolerance - It terminates the unhealthy instance and creates the new one.
               3. Cost management - It saves the cost by creating instance when it needs when loads come on server and it terminate the instance when load decreases.

    steps: > Create one template(select software configuration and AMI image)
           > Go to auto scaling and configure setting 
           > Create Target tracking scaling policy in this select cpu utilization metrics......so whenver it cross the cpu utlization limit then instance will auto create.
           > Also define desired, maximum and minimum capcity
           > After saving all configuration, instance will create, Now take SSH of instance and apply stress on instance and when is cross the desired value servers will scale uo
             and when load decreses it will scale down instance to its original state.

AWS VPC:-

1. What is VPC ?
Ans:1. VPC stands for virtual private cloud.
    2. VPC is used to create virtual private cloud, here we can create our own network and we can manage traffic .
    3. we can create subnet within vpc network.

2. What are the Subnets when working with VPC ?
Ans: subnets are the range of ipaddresses within a network which are reserved so that they are not available to everyone within network. we can create a multiple subnets

3. What is NAT Device ?
Ans: NAT stands for network address translation. we are attaching nat to private addresses for accessing internet. we can attach nat to multiple private subnets.

4. What is the difference between stateful & stateless filtering ?
Ans: network firewall rule groups works on stateful and stateless
    stateful:
     1. Stateful network traffic handling is the default behavior of security groups in AWS VPC.
     2. A stateful group security group allows inbound traffic for a specific rule and automatically allows the corresponding outboud traffic, regardless of whether
        an explicit outbound rule is defined.
     3. In ul you only need to configure inbound traffic no need to define outbound traffic.

   stateless: 
     1. With stateless network ACLs, you need to define both inbound and outbound rules to control the flow of traffic accurately.
     2. Each rule in a stateless network ACL controls either inbound or outbound traffic, and there is no automatic allowance of return traffic like in stateful security groups.

 
5. What are the advantages of using default VPC ?
Ans: When you launch resources in a default VPC, you can benefit from the advanced networking functionalities of Amazon VPC.

6. What is the internet gateway in VPC ?
Ans: 1.A internet gateway is horizontally scaled, and highly available vpc component that allows communication between youe vpc and the internet.
     2.Internet Gateway enables resources (like EC2 instances) in public subnets to connect to the internet.
     3. Internet Gateway supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.     
     4. Internet Gateway is not Availability Zone specific.
     5. Thereâ€™s no additional charge for having an internet gateway in your account.

7. What is Network ACL in VPC ?
Ans: 
What is the Security Group in VPC ?
What is an Elastic IP Address in VPC, and why do we need to use, realtime example ?
Can we attach one Production Elastic IP to the new Prod server ?
How does ELB Affect a VPC ?
What are the limitations of VPCâ€™s, Gateway and subnets ?
What is a Public IP Address and why do we use it ?
Explain Bastion Host Concept ?
When do we need to create a new customised VPC ?
What is Peering ? Why do we need to peer at two VPCâ€™s ?
What is VPN, Where do we use VPN Tunnel ?

CloudFront=

1. what is amazon cloudfront and use?
Ans: 1. Cloudfront is a web service which speeds up your distribution of static and dynamic content such html, css, images files to your users. 
     2. Cloudfront reduces the latency for accessing wesites. Cloudfront helps for storing caches of data at edge locations which are distributed globally and whenver user accessing
        that particular website then he is able to access website fastly without any latency.
     3. If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.
     4. If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've definedâ€”such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel,
        or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.

Elastic Beanstalk:

Que 1: What is amazon elastic beanstalk service?
Ans: 1. elastic beanstalk service is used for application deployement and rolling deployement(we can update the versions).
     2. elastic beanstalk service is PAAS service. In this service you just need to define your requirement, it will automatically create a environment for application deployement and
        after application deployement you can create a versions and you can update the versions.
     3. It configures automatically various amazon services like EC2 insatance creation, auto scaling, SNS, load balancer, cloudwatch and etc.
     4. This service manages application deployement, upload version, launch environment, manage environment.

Que 2: which are the elastic beanstalk deployement strategies?
Ans: 1. All-at-once - It deployes the application on all instances.
     2. Rolling - IT Splits the instances into batches and deploys to one batch at a time.(like suppose we have 6 instances then it will create 2 batches of 3 instance and deploye
                                                                                            application on one by one batch)
     3. Rolling with additional batch - It Splits the deployments into batches but for the first batch creates new EC2 instances instead of deploying on the existing EC2 instances.(so
                                        if we have two batches of 3 instance, so it will create a replica of first batch and deploy application in the first batch, it will not deploy
                                        application in existing instance)
     4. Immutable - If you need to deploy with a new instance instead of using an existing instance.(so it will create a new instance and will deploy a application in new instance)
     5. Traffic splitting - Performs immutable deployment and then forwards percentage of traffic to the new instances for a pre-determined duration of time. 
                            If the instances stay healthy, then forward all traffic to new instances and shut down old instances.
